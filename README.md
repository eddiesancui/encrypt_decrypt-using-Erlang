# How to use the code:
1. Download and install erlang first (please find tutorial online).
2. Clone/download the file.
3. Open terminal with the directory of the file. (Work in the terminal)
4. Type "erl"
5. Compile the the file by typing "c(encrypt_decrypt)." --- encrypt_decrypt is the file name. If you edit the file name, you should use the edited file name here.
6. Type the text and the key text you want to encrypt through typing "encrypt_decrypt:encrypt("your_text", "you_key_text")."
   note: this will only work with purely lowercase.
7. to decrypt type "encrypt_decrypt:decrypt("the_ciphertext_produced_with_your_encryption", "you_key_text")."
   note: always end with a period(.).
8. If you get a cipher text and decrypted text back to your original text, it means the app worked as intended.
